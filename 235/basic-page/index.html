            It is in that sense that Mario Kart Wii has been polished, has been well thought-out and is brilliant. 
            Nintendo really need to get their arse together and start pushing the technology like they did with Super Mario Galaxy. 
            Poor presentation should not be an issue in this generation of gaming, particularly with the other consoles doing it so well, 
            but, thankfully for us (as Wii owners), this game is a living, breathing example of gameplay over graphics.
