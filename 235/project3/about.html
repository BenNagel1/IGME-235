    <h1>Project 3: Mini-Golf</h1>

    <h2>Layout:</h2>
    <img src="images/IMG_2260.png" height="500px">

    <h2>Controls:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Move Mouse: Turns golf club towards mouse position</li>
        <li>Left Click: First click sets club position, then the second click hits the ball at a power based on how far away the mouse has moved from the original position</li>
        <li>Right Click: Ends the locked club position and returns the player to aiming the club</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gameplay:</h2>
    <p>The plan is to create at least 5 levels of mini-golf in increasing difficulty.
        Rules are the same as mini-golf and players aim to get the levels completed in the least amount of shots.
        If there is enough time, I plan to add things like boosters or bumpers to make the game more interesting.
