    <h1>Project 3: Mini-Golf</h1>

    <h2>Concept:</h2>
    <p>
        The plan is to create at least 5 levels of mini-golf in increasing difficulty.
        Rules are the same as mini-golf and players aim to get the levels completed in the least amount of shots.
        If there is enough time, I plan to add things like boosters or bumpers to make the game more interesting 
        (final product has rough grass and ice areas instead).
    </p>

    <h2>Genre:</h2>
    <p>Sports and Puzzle</p>

    <h2>Platform:</h2>
    <p>Desktop web</p>

    <h2>Story:</h2>
    <p>There is no story. Just a casual mini-golf game.</p>

    <h2>Aesthetics:</h2>
    <p>A top-down, colorful, and simple design. I want it to feel like the old mini-golf flash games.</p>

    <h2>Gameplay:</h2>
    <p>Use your mouse and left click to get the ball in the hole in as little hits as possible. 
        There are 5 levels total and your goal is to make it through them with a score under par.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Light Green = Normal grass that will not affect your ball in any way.</li>
        <li>Dark Green = Rough grass that will slow down your ball.</li>
        <li>Blue = Ice that will stop your ball from slowing down. Make sure to aim properly before going over ice as it you won't be able to stop on it!</li>
        <li>Brown = Walls that you can not pass through and will bounce off of.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Controls:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Move Mouse: Turns your golf club opposite of the mouse position (the ball will travel AWAY from your mouse). The further away your cursor is, the more power you get.</li>
            <li>Left Click: Hits the ball in the direction and power specified. You may only hit your ball once it has come to a complete stop. The opacity of the club displays this.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Genre:</h2>
    <p>Desktop web</p>

        <li>Used this source in order to understand the ins and outs of phaser. Was the only real place I went to get information as there are examples for everything basic that you need. <a href="https://labs.phaser.io/">https://labs.phaser.io/</a></li>

    <h2>How I felt:</h2>
    <p>Overall I had a ton of fun working on this project and figuring out the ins and outs of a new game development process.
        I used phaser js to complete this assignement and primarily used their examples to guide me through coding it.
        I'm most proud of my code structure and the way I handled the building blocks of each hole. Once I was done I could make levels in 5 minutes due to the method I set up.
