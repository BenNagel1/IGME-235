        <ul>
            <li>Move Mouse: Turns your golf club opposite of the mouse position (the ball will travel AWAY from your mouse). The further away your cursor is, the more power you get.</li>
            <li>Left Click: Hits the ball in the direction and power specified. You may only hit your ball once it has come to a complete stop. The opacity of the club displays this.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay:</h2>
            <p>Use your mouse and left click to get the ball in the hole in as little hits as possible. 
            There are 5 levels total and your goal is to make it through them with a score under par.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Light Green = Normal grass that will not affect your ball in any way.</li>
            <li>Dark Green = Rough grass that will slow down your ball.</li>
            <li>Blue = Ice that will stop your ball from slowing down. Make sure to aim properly before going over ice as it you won't be able to stop on it!</li>
            <li>Brown = Walls that you can not pass through and will bounce off of.</li>
        </ul>
